# vStoreBackend
This repo contains the back end code (Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker) for my very simple photo sharing web application. This project was created because I desired to try out FastAPI. I must say, I am impressed with their documentation, as well as the built-in /docs feature that essentially (1) documents the api code, and (2) allows users to test their api without using a third party app (Postman) or CURL. 

## UPDATE

The heroku deployment is unstable and I've run into some billing problems whilst using AWS S3. I am currently updating this backend to deploy it using Google Cloud (with firebase for the photo storage). Thank you for your patience.

## UPDATE #2

I've since deployed the api using Google's Cloud platform.

## FINAL UPDATE

Ran out of money, so I've decided to focus more on creating applications that were free to deploy (deploying web apps using Vercel, creating desktop apps, etc). This was an amazingly difficult app to get up and running (python dependency conflicts, errors while deploying the database, finances), but it was extremely valuable to my growth as a self taught developer.

Best,

Klay
