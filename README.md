# vStoreBackend
This repo contains the back end code (Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker) for my very simple video streaming web application. This project was created because I desired to try out FastAPI. I must say, I am impressed with their documentation, as well as the built-in /docs feature that essentially (1) documents the api code, and (2) allows users to test their api without using a third party app (Postman) or CURL. 

## UPDATE

The heroku deployment is unstable and I've run into some problems whilst using AWS S3. I am currently updating this backend to deploy it using Google Cloud (with firebase for the video storage). Thank you for your patience.
